# Quality Control concepts of Next Generation Sequencing with Illumina

Undertand and interpret the main quality control of the analisys of the raw data with fastqc

## About the course

This course is address to researchers with not prior experience in bioinformatics, they will be able to interpret the main parameters of FASTQC quality control tool for short reads (Illumina) and known the main tools for remove low quality reads and adapater content. 

### Outline
