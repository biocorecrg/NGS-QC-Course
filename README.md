# Quality Control concepts of Next Generation Sequencing with Illumina

Understand and interpret the basics of quality control in the main steps of the NGS pipeline, such as library preparation, sequencing reads, preprocessing and alignment. 
## About the course

This course is addressed to researchers with no prior experience in bioinformatics, they will be able to know the prone error steps during the library prepration, the main parameters of FASTQC quality control tool for short reads (Illumina), know the main tools for removing low quality reads and adapter content, the different aligment tools available and the main quality control parameters to chceck after alignment.
