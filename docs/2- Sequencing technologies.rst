Short Reads sequencing (Illumina)
=================================

It consist in The  polymerase-mediated Sequencing by synthesis (SBS), this works
by coupling the four DNA bases to fluorescent markers alongside a terminator
chemical group that pauses DNA synthesis. While DNA is being synthesized, each
fluorescent marker is optically verified before the tag and terminator are
removed, and the next step in the sequence is recorded. 


1. **Cluster generation**

During Library preparation adapters are added to the DNA fragments, which are
used to hybridize the DNA to the flow cell, subsequentlty PCR amplification
(bridge amplification) generates a cluster of the same sequence fragment to
amplify the signal when the nucleotide base is synthesized, thus obtaining a
multiple cluster on a Flow Cell. 

Adapters also act as barcaodes or index (a short unique sequence) that identify
the sample, when multiples samples are pooled in a single run. Depending on the
type of sequencing, the adapater can be added to one end of the fragment (single
end) or both ends (paired end).

2. **Sequencing**

On each cycle, one nucleotide is incorporated into the template; it corresponds to
the read length (100 cycles equal to 100 bp read length). A single fluorescently
labeled reversible terminator-bound dNTP is incorporated into the nucleic acid
chain during each sequencing cycle, and the resulting fluorescent signal is
imaged. The terminator and fluorescent dye are cleaved from the incorporated
dNTP to allow the next labeled dNTP to be added

Single end vs Paired end
-------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Single end

      Sequence is read from one end of the fragment. It's more simple and effcient,
      also a reduce number of steps during the library preparation is required.
      However, the quality of nucleotides decreases as the sequencing process
      progresses, so the ends of the reads tend to have lower quality scores.


   .. tab:: Paired end

      The adapaters attached to both ends of the fragment allows to reading at one
      read, when it finishes this direction at the specified read lenght, then starts
      another round of reading from the opposite end of the fragment. Thus obtaining
      two reads for each fragment.	

      It improves:

      - The confidence of the sequence read (error rate of 0.1%)
      - The ability to identify the relative positions of various reads in the genome
        (much more efficient in resolve rearrangements such as insertions, deletions
        or inversions)
      - Can improve the assembly of repetitive regions. 
      - On the ohter hand is more expensive and time-consuming (respect single end)

Long read sequencing (Nanopore)
===============================

Use flow cells which contain an array of tiny holes nanopores (protein pore)
embedded in an electro-resistant membrane. Each nanopore corresponds to its own
electrode connected to a channel and sensor chip, which measures the electric
current that flows through the nanopore. 

When a molecule passes through a nanopore, the current is disrupted to produce a
characteristic ‘squiggle’. The squiggle is then decoded using basecalling
algorithms to determine the DNA or RNA sequence in real time. In an electrolytic
solution, a constant voltage is applied to produce an ionic current through the
nanopore such that negatively charged single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules are
driven through the nanopore from the negatively charged ‘cis’ side to the
positively charged ‘trans’ side. 

Translocation speed is controlled by a motor protein that ratchets the nucleic
acid molecule through the nanopore in a step-wise manner. In addition to
controlling translocation speed, the motor protein has helicase activity,
enabling double-stranded DNA or RNA–DNA duplexes to be unwound into
single-stranded molecules that pass through the nanopore. Changes in the ionic
current during translocation correspond to the nucleotide sequence present in
the sensing region and are decoded using computational algorithms, allowing
real-time sequencing of single molecules.

A basecaller translates raw signals into DNA sequence data (FASTQ). The
basecaller uses a neural network to predict the most likely DNA sequence based
on the raw signal data.

FASTQ format and Phred quality score
=====================================

The raw data generated by the sequencer is stored in FASTQ format, which
contains the sequence of nucleotides and their corresponding quality scores
(phred scores). For Illumina Paired end sequencing, two FASTQ files are
generated, one for each read direction.

For each read, the information it's divided in four lines:

  1. Sequence identifier: starts with '@' and contains information about the
     read. Such as the instrument, run ID, flow cell ID, lane, tile, x, y
     coordinates, and read number.

  .. Note::
    The @ symbol can not be used for count the number of reads, because it could also appear as a quality score symbol.

  2. Sequence: the nucleotide sequence of the read.
  
  3. Quality identifier: starts with '+' and contains the same information as
     the sequence identifier. Or it may be empty and in some cases is used for
     metadata.
  
  4. Quality scores: the Phred quality score for each base in the read. The
     Phred quality score is a measure of the quality of the base call, 
  
    .. math::
        Q = -10 * log10(P)
    
    Where P is the probability of the base call being incorrect. The quality
    scores range from 0 to 41, but the values are in ASCII (base 33) encoding in
    order to reduce file size. In older versions of the FASTQ format, the
    quality scores were encoded in ASCII (base 64) encoding. The higher the
    quality score, the lower the probability of an incorrect base call.
